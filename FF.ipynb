They need to provide fast and reliable storage for databases, root images and other data used by the containers.

A pod can define a volume, such as a local disk directory or a network disk, and expose it to the containers in the pod.

An object which is of an interface type is also of another type, much like C++ objects being simultaneously of a base and derived class.

The definition of an interface type lists required methods by name and type. For each type T and each non-negative integer constant n, there is an array type denoted [n]T; arrays of differing lengths are thus of different types. For a pair of types K, V, the type map[K]V is the type of hash tables mapping type-K keys to type-V values. : 282–283 Besides calling methods via interfaces, Go allows converting interface values to other types with a run-time type check.\n",

       " 'Kubernetes (, commonly stylized as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management. Google originally designed Kubernetes, but the Cloud Native Computing Foundation now maintains the project.\\nKubernetes works with Containerd, and CRI-O.  Originally, it interfaced exclusively with the Docker runtime through a \"Dockershim\"; however, from November 2020 up to April 2022, Kubernetes has deprecated the shim in favor of directly interfacing with the container through Containerd, or replacing Docker with a runtime that is compliant with the Container Runtime Interface (CRI). With the release of v1.24 in May 2022, \"Dockershim\" has been removed entirely.\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"This storage can also be used as shared disk space for containers within the pod. For some use cases, though, there could be a need to run a pod on every single node in the cluster. Containers may be ephemeral, but more and more of their data is not, so one needs to ensure the data's survival in case of container termination or hardware failure. They need to provide fast and reliable storage for databases, root images and other data used by the containers. Each pod in Kubernetes is assigned a unique IP address within the cluster, allowing applications to use ports without the risk of conflict. A pod can define a volume, such as a local disk directory or a network disk, and expose it to the containers in the pod. Volumes are mounted at specific mount points within the container, which are defined by the pod configuration, and cannot mount onto other volumes or link to other volumes.\",\n",

Depending on whether the version control system in use is distributed, like Git or Mercurial, or centralized, like Subversion, CVS, or Perforce, the whole set of information in the repository may be duplicated on every user's system or may be maintained on a single server. Some of the metadata that a repository contains includes, among other things, a historical record of changes in the repository, a set of commit objects, and a set of references to commit objects, called heads.\\nThe main purpose of a repository is to store a set of files, as well as the history of changes made to those files. Exactly how each version control system handles storing those changes, however, differs greatly. For instance, Subversion in the past relied on a database instance but has since moved to storing its changes directly on the filesystem. These differences in storage techniques have generally led to diverse uses of version control by different groups, depending on their needs.\\n\\n\",\n",

An object which is of an interface type is also of another type, much like C++ objects being simultaneously of a base and derived class. Across package boundaries, Go includes a canonical error type, and multi-value returns using this type are the standard idiom. The definition of an interface type lists required methods by name and type. For each type T and each non-negative integer constant n, there is an array type denoted [n]T; arrays of differing lengths are thus of different types. For a pair of types K, V, the type map[K]V is the type of hash tables mapping type-K keys to type-V values. : 282–283 Besides calling methods via interfaces, Go allows converting interface values to other types with a run-time type check.']"
